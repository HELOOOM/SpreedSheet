# SpreedSheet

## Introduction

A spreadsheet is a grid composed of an indefinite number of rows and columns that cross to make cells where information is entered. Many people use spreadsheets because of their easy-to-operate functions. Spreadsheets once were known as worksheets used for educational and business purposes only. Today spreadsheets have been discovered also by moms making shopping lists and children creating Christmas wish lists.

## Functionality

Spreadsheets feature columns and rows to keep inserted information legible and simple to understand. You can use spreadsheets to enter data, calculate equations and create charts and graphs. Spreadsheet software has the capability to create a million rows by 16,000 columns, easily enough space to store large databases of text and data.
